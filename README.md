Hey, It's Me, Sibaji!

Welcome to my first real-life project! In this project, I've delved into the realms of Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS), Database Management Systems (DBMS), MySQL, and MySQL Connectivity.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies
- `resources`: the folder where the sql code is present

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.
